         Buster: It was a wild, wild ride. Did you enjoy your lunch, mom? You drank it fast enough.
         You mean the guy we're meeting with can't even grow his own hair? Come on! You're losing blood,
         aren't you? Probably, my socks are wet. Shémale. Come on, this is a Bluth family celebration.
         It's no place for children. If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong.
         I love all of my children equally. [earlier] I don't care for Gob. That's the first time we were
         in the shower since our honeymoon. And this time, no tears.   What about macaroni – let me finish –
         salad? Oh, like when they say "poofter" to mean "tourist", yes.

        You don't want a hungry dove down your pants. I don't want no part of yo' tight-ass country club,
        ya freak bitch! Get rid of the Seaward. Lucille: I'll leave when I'm good and ready.

       This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. No, she's in it. She's a contestant.
       It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. So you take your mom to work every day? Bummer.
       Moms are such a pain in the ass, huh? It's, like, die already! Ah coodle doodle doo, ah coodle doodle doo.

         The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Hey campers!
         You just made a fool out of yourself in front of T-Bone. I may have committed some light treason.
         Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Yo quiero leche. Yo quiero leche de madre. Buster's in what we like
         to call a light to no coma. In layman's terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap.
